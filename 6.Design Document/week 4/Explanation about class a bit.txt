Given what the teacher said about the pedestrians, we can just assume those are also a type 
of a lane, they also have a flow and their traffic light.So considering that we have a traffic light per
lane we don't really need the traffic light class anymore, we set the intervals of the stages in The class
Traffic light stage, which will contain a list of all lanes that are a part of this stage.
I also proposed creating the class field, which will hold our crossing, might be unnecesary to be honest,
but I wanted to see how it might look like.
